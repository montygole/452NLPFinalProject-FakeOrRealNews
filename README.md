# 452NLPFinalProject-FakeOrRealNews

Project Description: This project uses data from https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?select=True.csv to train a DecisionTree model from Sci-Kit Learn to classify an english news article as "Fake" or not. It allows a user to create a text file which has a news article of their choice's information.

How to use: 
1. Create a text file called 'article.txt'
2. Make the text file's lines correspond to
    Line 1: Article Tite
    Line 2: Article Publish Date
    Line 3-END: Article's Text
3. Run the file called: 'main.ipynb'. But remember to install program-specific dependencies you don't have.
4. Look at the bottom of the 'main.ipynb' file to see your article's results!
